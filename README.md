# HRR_meas-uncertainty-estimation
The is the code generates synthetic oxygen consumption calorimetry data and calculates the expected measurement uncertainty, given calorimeter specification and heat release rates. This code estimates the uncertainty of a proposed calorimeter design. 

To use open the data input file. The file imports the calorimeter specfications into the fire and uncertainty models. Then it then gererates the synthetic steady state measurements for the given HRR array.
